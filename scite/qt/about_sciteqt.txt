SciteQt is a port of the SciTE editor to the Qt QML/Quick platform, 
which is optimized for touch devices.

All target platforms of the Qt framework are supported (Android, IOS, 
Webassembly, Windows, Mac and Linux). The application runs even in 
a browser via Webassembly (https://mneuroth.github.io/SciTEQtWASM/).
The minimum Qt version needed to compile SciteQt is Qt 5.11.3.

The current homepage of the project can be found on github:

SciteQt ist still under development, therefore it has most probably 
some bugs and not all the features of the SciTE editor are implemented 
yet.

Qt supports different styles. In SciteQt the JavaScript function style(name)
can be used to select the style permanently. The available styles are:

  * Default
  * Material
  * Universal
  * Fusion

Use this command to switch to Material style: style("Material")

  * added menu item "About Current File"
  * added menu item "Open Containing Folder"
  * Find in files implementation supports regular expressions
  * Support connect/disconnect of monitors
  * Support of switch between menubar for desktop and mobile platforms
  * Added command line option to select language, i. e. --language=de
