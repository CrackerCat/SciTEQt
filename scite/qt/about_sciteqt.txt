SciteQt is a port of the SciTE editor to the Qt QML/Quick platform, 
which is optimized for touch devices.

All target platforms of the Qt framework are supported (Android, IOS, 
Webassembly, Windows, Mac and Linux). The application runs even in 
a browser via Webassembly (http://mneuroth.de/sciteqt.html)

The current homepage of the project can be found on github:

SciteQt ist still under development, therefore it has most probably 
some bugs and not all the features of the SciTE editor are implemented 
yet.

Missing features are:

  * Context menus
  * Printing
  * Execute external Scripts (build, go, stop, etc.)
  * Find in Files dialog
  * Abrev dialog
  * TabSize dialog
  * Parameters dialog
  * Parameters open
  * Parameter grab
  * Find/Replace extended dialog
