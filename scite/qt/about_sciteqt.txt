SciteQt is a port of the SciTE editor to the Qt QML/Quick platform, 
which is optimized for touch devices.

All target platforms of the Qt framework are supported (Android, IOS, 
Webassembly, Windows, Mac and Linux). The application runs even in 
a browser via Webassembly (http://mneuroth.de/sciteqt.html).
The minimum Qt version needed to compile SciteQt is Qt 5.11.3.

The current homepage of the project can be found on github: 

  https://github.com/mneuroth/SciTEQt

SciteQt ist still under development, therefore it has most probably 
some bugs and not all the features of the SciTE editor are implemented 
yet.

Added freatures (compared to original SciTE):

  * updated Icons for toolbar (using: https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=build&style=baseline)
  * show current file in statusbar when find in files is running
  * show tooltip help for buttons in toolbar
  * show full path of file as tooltip for tabbar buttons
  * switch between two last activated tab pages ("Switch to last activated Tab" --> Ctrl+Tab)
  * added Accelerator Key for "Selection &Add Each" --> Ctrl+Shift+A
  * added menu item "About Current File"
  * added menu item "Open Containing Folder"
  * Find in files implementation supports regular expressions
  * Support connect/disconnect of monitors
  * Support of switch between menubar for desktop and mobile platforms
  * Added command line option to select language, i. e. --language=de
  * Added support to run current text/script as JavaScript (via QML)

Missing features are:

  * scrolling with mouse wheel is sluggish
  * save and restore file extensions and directories for find in files
  * Improve splitter handling
  * Implement Printing (partly)
  * Context menu for Scintilla Control can not be overwritten/updated by SciTE  
  * Android: improve selection of text --> improve/use QInputContext
  * Android: implement action for left menu button (three bars button) --> dialogs ?
  * Android: improve deployment --> more languages?
  * Webassembly: processing of modal dialogs (FileDialog, MessageBox)
  * Webassembly: click on Buttons (i. e. Cancel) in Dialogs creates crash ! BUT: setting focus via Keyboard and return on button works sometimes !!!???

New open features might be:
  * Navigate in file via "Goto Symbol under Cursor"
  * Autocomplete symbols/functions/variables inside the file
  * Close buttons in tabpage buttons
  * Show all occurences of find in current file in outputarea
  * maybe: save and restore text in outputarea?
  * Scite Logo as left button in title bar or Settings dialog/find dialog ... ? (Fast Access Menu Items?)
  * Save and Restore for View-Parameters like: show line numbers, etc.
  * Save and Restore user defined mapping of file extensions to (lexer-)languages

Known and open Bugs are:

  * View of fonts may be corrupted after attatching/detaching monitors to the computer... ==> restart application again
  * Crash Ctrl+0  --> Load lua (user command) --> only MSC Compiler 2017; MSC 2019? MacOS ==> but gcc/mingw are working !
  * first Menu Item in Menu is empty on Qt 5.11.3 --> ok after switch between mobile and desktop ui !
  * strange scroll behaviour on Qt 5.11.3 --> mouse click needed to update mouse wheel scroll in scintilla window (see about scite)
  * Improve handling of last searches in find dialog --> update combobox content directly
  * MacOS: select directory in find in files dialog does not work
  * Android: Navigate directory in Find In Files Dialog does not work for android
  * Android: SaveAsCopy on Android Storage Access Framework changes the filename
  * Android: Files from android storage access framework will not be restored at application startup
  * CI: Windows CI build does not fail if compile step has an error and sciteqt.exe was not created ... ? Why? See Mingw Build for 32 bit

Watch:
  * Memory leak when switching between tab pages?
  * Sporadic crashes with F5 und Scripts with long outputs --> maybe better after creating QProcess in own thread
