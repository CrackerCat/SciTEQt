SciteQt is a port of the SciTE editor to the Qt QML/Quick platform, 
which is optimized for touch devices.

All target platforms of the Qt framework are supported (Android, IOS, 
Webassembly, Windows, Mac and Linux). The application runs even in 
a browser via Webassembly (http://mneuroth.de/sciteqt.html).
The minimum Qt version needed to compile SciteQt is Qt 5.11.3.

The current homepage of the project can be found on github: 

  https://github.com/mneuroth/SciTEQt

SciteQt ist still under development, therefore it has most probably 
some bugs and not all the features of the SciTE editor are implemented 
yet.

Qt supports different styles. In SciteQt the JavaScript function style(name)
can be used to select the style permanently. The available styles are:

  * Default
  * Material
  * Universal
  * Fusion

Use this command to switch to Material style: style("Material")

Added features (compared to original SciTE):

  * updated Icons for toolbar (using: https://material.io/resources/icons/?icon=build&style=baseline)
  * show current file in statusbar when find in files is running
  * show tooltip help for buttons in toolbar
  * show full path of file as tooltip for tabbar buttons
  * switch between two last activated tab pages ("Switch to last activated Tab" --> Ctrl+Tab)
  * added Accelerator Key for "Selection &Add Each" --> Ctrl+Shift+A
  * added menu item "About Current File"
  * added menu item "Open Containing Folder"
  * Find in files implementation supports regular expressions
  * Support connect/disconnect of monitors
  * Support of switch between menubar for desktop and mobile platforms
  * Added command line option to select language, i. e. --language=de
  * Added support to run current text/script as JavaScript (via QML)
  * Allow selection of styles via JavaScript function: style("StyleName")
  * Save and restore of extensions and paths in find in files dialog
  * Select word under cursor (Ctr+W)

Missing features are:

  * Improve splitter handling
  * Implement Printing (partly)
  * Context menu for Scintilla Control can not be overwritten/updated by SciTE  
# * Android: Support and Pay Page
? * Android: improve deployment --> more languages?

New open features might be:

  * support Dark Theme for Scintilla --> background -> black ?
  * Allow user to configure (menu)items in tool button (android) ?
  * Navigate in file via "Goto Symbol under Cursor"
  * Autocomplete symbols/functions/variables inside the file
  * Close buttons in tabpage buttons
  * Show all occurences of find in current file in output area
  * maybe: save and restore text in outputarea?
  * Save and Restore for View-Parameters like: show line numbers, etc.
  * Save and Restore user defined mapping of file extensions to (lexer-)languages
  * Support graphics output like visiscript extensions (pay?)
  * Support more scripting languages via termux or visiscript extensions (pay?)

Known and open Bugs are:

  * Use signing data for visiscript instead of mobile gnuplot viewer
  * CI: Windows CI build does not fail if compile step has an error and sciteqt.exe was not created ... ? Why? See Mingw Build for 32 bit
  * MACOS: support qt translations like qt_de.qm
  * Initial horizontal Scrollbar size (width of maximum screen? logical width?)
  * Strange output (no clipping) if CR/LF should be shown
  * View of fonts may be corrupted after attatching/detaching monitors to the computer... ==> restart application again
  * Main Menu sometimes not completly visible after monitor/resolution change
  * Crash Ctrl+0  --> Load lua (user command) --> only MSC Compiler 2017; MSC 2019? MacOS ==> but gcc/mingw are working !
  * first Menu Item in Menu is empty on Qt 5.11.3 --> ok after switch between mobile and desktop ui !
  * Android: Bug? touch on dialog and then back button -> closes app
  * MacOS: select directory in find in files dialog does not work
- * WASM: Close tab with changed data --> 2x messagebox quittieren --> liegt an emscripten_sleep() exception ! --> TODO: test with new 5.15 release build --> ASYNCIFY !?
- * WASM: Exception in text not found Message box (aber: Verhalten ok) --> liegt an emscripten_sleep() exception !
  * WASM: improve SaveAs
  * WASM: test all other load and save functions
  * WASM: support translations?
  * WASM: support Export menu items lik pdf, text, ...
  ==> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebassembly-platform-notes.html
  (* WASM: improve keyboard handling / shortcuts for messageboxes

Watch:
  * Memory leak when switching between tab pages?
  * Sporadic crashes with F5 und Scripts with long outputs --> maybe better after creating QProcess in own thread
